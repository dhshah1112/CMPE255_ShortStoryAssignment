# CMPE255_ShortStoryAssignment

The assignment was to take a recent research/ survey paper and summarize it. The paper that I took : https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08234.

First of all, I created medium article and published the article that pretty much had the whole summary of the paper that I chose.

First article : https://medium.com/@dhshah1112/unleashing-efficiency-in-nlp-the-power-of-transformer-based-multi-task-learning-c07288c3cd83

Second(updated) article: https://medium.com/@dhshah1112/advancing-nlp-the-impact-and-future-of-transformer-based-multi-task-learning-1bc42722320c

Then I went on and created a PPT that had the gist of medium article as well as the paper that I chose. Link to the PPT : https://www.slideshare.net/DhruvalShah36/shortstorypptpptx

I have made a video of myself explaining the PPT, basically summarizing the paper and medium article all at once.
